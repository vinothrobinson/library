# library
This is another project from The Odin Project. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a library that stores books. This project uses objects to help keep the code more organized. 

NOTE: The project is supposed to support local storage, but currently there is an issue where it does not work with GitHub Pages
